# Local Cursor Rules (Persistent, Do NOT push)

- Critical: Do NOT push commits, tags, or branches to any remote unless the user explicitly says to push.
- Default behavior: Keep all changes local. Use staging and commits only when asked; never push automatically.
- Versioning on push: When the user explicitly asks to push, bump `pubspec.yaml` version by +0.1 (minor), reset patch to 0, increment build number, commit with a clear message, tag the release, and then push.
- Zero Risk Mandate: For any code edits, follow the repository's ZERO RISK rules strictly (feature flags, backups, verification, try/catch with safe fallbacks, and no breaking of existing flows).
- Printing safety: Changes to printing must be feature-flagged and revertible; preserve existing formatting as a fallback.
- Emulator/device operations: It is safe to build, install, and launch APKs locally without asking, but never publish or upload artifacts unless requested.

Notes:
- This file is local-only and must not be committed. Obey the "no push unless asked" rule at all times.
