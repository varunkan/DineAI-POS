# AI POS System - Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL: Code Quality and Duplication Prevention

**BEFORE making ANY changes to the codebase:**

1. **ALWAYS check existing functions and methods** in the application workspace
2. **Search for duplicate or similar functionality** before writing new code
3. **Review application logic already written** to prevent rework
4. **Ensure no duplicate methods** are added as they cause ambiguity and make debugging difficult

## Development Guidelines

- **Search First**: Always search the codebase for existing implementations before adding new code
- **Prevent Duplication**: Duplicate methods create ambiguity and debugging nightmares
- **Review Existing Logic**: Check what's already implemented to avoid unnecessary rework
- **Maintain Code Quality**: Keep the codebase clean and maintainable

## Flutter/Dart Specific Rules

- Follow Flutter best practices and conventions
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent code formatting
- Ensure proper state management patterns

## Project Context

This is a multi-tenant restaurant POS system with:
- Authentication and user management
- Order processing and management
- Printer integration (WiFi/Bluetooth)
- Cross-device synchronization
- Inventory management
- Payment processing

**Remember**: Always check existing code before adding new functionality to prevent duplication and maintain code quality.
