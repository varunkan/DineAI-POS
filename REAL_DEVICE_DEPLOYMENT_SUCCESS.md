## **🔍 Current Status**

### **Device Information**
```
Device ID: 202525900101062
Status: device (authorized)
Network: 192.168.50.220/24
Network Type: Real WiFi network
```

### **What's Different from Emulator**
- **Emulator**: `10.0.2.x` (isolated virtual network)
- **Real Device**: `192.168.50.x` (real network with potential printers)

## **🖨️ Printer Discovery Expectations**

### **Now Working on Real Device:**
1. **Real Network Access**: Can scan actual network for printers
2. **Printer Communication**: Can connect to real network printers
3. **Network Discovery**: Will find printers on `192.168.50.x` network

### **What to Test:**
1. **Open the POS app** on your real device
2. **Go to Settings** → **Printer Management**
3. **Run printer discovery** - it should now find real printers
4. **Check if any printers** are visible on your network

## **📱 Next Steps**

### **1. Test Printer Discovery**
- Open the app on your real device
- Navigate to printer settings
- Run network printer discovery
- Check what printers are found

### **2. If No Printers Found**
- Verify printers are on the same `192.168.50.x` network
- Check printer network settings
- Ensure printers have network connectivity

### **3. If Printers Are Found**
- Test printer connections
- Configure printer assignments
- Test printing functionality

## **🔧 Troubleshooting**

### **If Device Disconnects:**
```bash
adb kill-server && adb start-server
adb devices
```

### **If App Doesn't Launch:**
```bash
adb -s 202525900101062 shell am start -n com.restaurantpos.ai_pos_system/.MainActivity
```

### **To Check Device Logs:**
```bash
adb -s 202525900101062 logcat | grep -i "printer\|discovery"
```

## **🎯 Success Metrics**

- ✅ **Real device connected and authorized**
- ✅ **Latest APK deployed successfully**
- ✅ **App launched on real device**
- ✅ **Real network access enabled**
- ✅ **Printer discovery ready for testing**
